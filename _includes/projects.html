    <h3> Reconstructing Obfuscated Human Faces </h3>

    </ul>
    <p>In photographic media, faces are often obfuscated to protect the identity of those pictured. This obfuscation process is done by removing details from the photograph in order to reduce the identifying facial features. However, these obfuscated images may still contain enough details such that the original features may be able to be recovered. In this project we will examine different neural networks to reconstruct obfuscated images of human faces.</p>

    <p> Handwritten digits are used in different type of data like cheque, post-mail, address on homeâ€™s name plate etc. Pattern recognition is a branch of machine learning that focuses on the recognition of patterns and regularities in data. Handwriting recognition is the ability of a computer to receive and interpret intelligible handwritten input from sources such as paper documents, photographs, touch-screens and other devices. It is concerned with a computer being able to understand human handwriting with efficiency. </p>
